What programming languages have you used?
I've used Javascript, Python, C, Html, Dart, Jython, and GDScript

Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.
I've coded pretty much entirely in classes, and somewhat on my own. I've created a lot of games, including a horror game, a job hiring simulator, and currently a firefighting FPS. I also created a Spotify
data parser for CS222. 

What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
I didn't code in it but I worked with a large sorting system during an internship at AISIN. As far as large programs/systems I've coded on, I've worked on several large group projects including a Wikipedia parser
and a Spotify parser.

What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
I feel most comfortable doing the programming. Once I'm given a goal, I like trying to explore and find the best way to accomplish it.

What do you feel least comfortable doing?
I feel least comfortable leading and making choices for the group.
